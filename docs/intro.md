# Welcome to DevNotes 📚

**DevNotes** is my personal developer wiki — a centralized knowledge hub built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to store and organize technical notes, mind maps, cheat sheets, and learning resources.  

It’s designed to be **fast**, **searchable**, and **version-friendly**, making it a perfect replacement for tools like Notion when you want something **lightweight, markdown-based, and developer-friendly**.
